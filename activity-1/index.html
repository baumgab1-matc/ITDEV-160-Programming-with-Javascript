    <h1>How I Start My Mornings</h1>
    <hr>
    
    <p>Heres a small page describing how I start my favorite time of the day - <strong>mornings!</strong> <br>
    Each morning my alarm is set to 5:30am but most mornings my dog wakes me up! <br>
    Once up, I have a routine I follow to a tee.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>The first step is the most important one! <b>Get coffee going!</b></li>
        <li>Refill dogs water</li>
        <li>Take dog to park</li>
    </ol>
    <br>

    <h2>At the Park</h2>
    <hr>

    <p>Once at the park, my routine is no longer followed to a tee, but usually consists of</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Throwing stick around with dog</li>
        <li>Looking at Lake Michigan</li>
        <li>Thinking about what needs to be done for the day</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Once back at the house the fun begins - <i>I finally get to have my coffee and eat breakfast!</i></p>
